<h1>Weather App</h1>

I've created a stunning weather app with a modern glass-morphism design that dynamically changes its appearance based on weather conditions. The app features real-time weather data, 5-day forecasts, city search, geolocation support, and temperature unit conversion.
The app includes comprehensive error handling and will guide users through the API key setup process. Once configured, it provides a beautiful, production-ready weather experience with smooth animations, responsive design, and intuitive user interactions.
